# Logic Portal

This is the portal for Logic Development Studios. All internal apps will be bootstrapped through here.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository in the same repository of Laradock. Then change the `APPLICATION` setting of your Laradock `.env` file to `../logic-portal/`. Run up on your laradock containers and you're good to go.

### Prerequisites

You will need an environment in which to run laravel apps. The suggested framework is [Laradock](http://laradock.io/introduction/) which requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run.
